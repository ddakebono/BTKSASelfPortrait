# BTKSASelfPortrait For ChilloutVR
BTK Standalone: Self Portrait is a small mod that adds a toggleable face camera to the Hud.

This mod requires [BTKUILib](https://github.com/BTK-Development/BTKUILib) or it will not work at all.

There's a couple settings in the BTK Settings menu that can be found in the QuickMenu!

1. Camera Distance - This setting allows you to fine tune how far away the face camera is from you.
2. UI Display Alpha Percentage - This setting allows you to set the level of transparency of the HUD element.
3. Flip Display - This flips the display so that it matches how mirrors in VRChat display you
4. Reflect Other Players - This option shows other players in your self portrait display
5. Camera Cutoff Distance - This sets the how far the camera will go behind you
6. UI Position X - Adjusts the X position of the display
7. UI Position Y - Adjusts the Y position of the display
8. UI Scale X - Adjusts the X scale of the display
